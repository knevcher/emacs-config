;;; Description: Run GNU Go in a buffer.

;;; Commentary:

;; Playing
;; -------
;;
;; This file provides the command `gnugo' which allows you to play the game of
;; go against the external program "gnugo" (http://www.gnu.org/software/gnugo)
;; in a dedicated Emacs buffer, or to resume a game in progress.  NOTE: In
;; this file, to avoid confusion w/ elisp vars and funcs, we use the term "GNU
;; Go" to refer to the process object created by running the external program.
;;
;; At the start of a new game, you can pass additional command-line arguments
;; to GNU Go to specify level, board size, color, komi, handicap, etc.  By
;; default GNU Go plays at level 10, board size 19, color white, and zero for
;; both komi and handicap.
;;
;; To play a stone, move the cursor to the desired vertice and type `SPC' or
;; `RET'; to pass, `P' (note: uppercase); to quit, `q'; to undo one of your
;; moves (as well as a possibly intervening move by GNU Go), `u'.  To undo
;; back through an arbitrary stone that you played, place the cursor on a
;; stone and type `U' (note: uppercase).  Other keybindings are described in
;; the `gnugo-board-mode' documentation, which you may view with the command
;; `describe-mode' (normally `C-h m') in that buffer.  The buffer name shows
;; the last move and who is currently to play.  Capture counts and other info
;; are shown on the mode line immediately following the major mode name.
;;
;; While GNU Go is pondering its next move, certain commands that rely on its
;; assistence will result in a "still waiting" error.  Do not be alarmed; that
;; is normal.  When it is your turn again you may retry the command.  In the
;; meantime, you can use Emacs for other tasks, or start an entirely new game
;; with `C-u M-x gnugo'.  (NOTE: A new game will slow down all games. :-)
;;
;; If GNU Go should crash during a game the mode line will show "no process".
;; Please report the event to the GNU Go maintainers so that they can improve
;; the program.
;;
;; This code was tested with:
;; - GNU Emacs: 21.3 / 22.0.50 (from CVS)
;; - GNU Go: 3.3.15 / 3.4 / 3.6
;;
;;
;; Meta-Playing (aka Customizing)
;; ------------------------------
;;
;; Customization is presently limited to
;;   vars:            `gnugo-program'
;;                    `gnugo-animation-string'
;;                    `gnugo-mode-line'
;;                    `gnugo-X-face' `gnugo-O-face' `gnugo-grid-face'
;;                    `gnugo-xpms'
;;   normal hooks:    `gnugo-board-mode-hook'
;;                    `gnugo-post-move-hook'
;;   and the keymap:  `gnugo-board-mode-map'
;;
;; The variable `gnugo-xpms' is a special case.  To set it you need to load
;; gnugo-xpms.el (http://www.emacswiki.org) or some other library w/ congruent
;; interface.
;;
;;
;; Meta-Meta-Playing (aka Hacking)
;; -------------------------------
;;
;; You may wish to first fix the bugs:
;; - `gnugo-toggle-dead-group' only half-complete; see docstring for details
;; - probably sgf handling is not 100% to spec
;; - subprocess should provide scoring details, gnugo.el not yet blissful
;;
;; Otherwise (we can live w/ some bugs), here are some ideas:
;; - talk GTP over the network
;; - "assist minor mode" (see gnugo-extra.el for work in progress)
;; - using assist minor mode, gnugo-v-gnugo (ibid)
;; - extract GNUGO Board mode and sgf stuff into sgf.el; make gnugo.el use it
;; - make gnugo (the external program) support query (read-only) thread
;;   so as to be able to lift "still waiting" restriction
;; - alternatively, extend GNUGO Board mode to manage another subprocess
;;   dedicated to analysis (no genmove)
;; - command `C' to add a comment to the sgf tree
;; - command `C-u =' to label a position
;; - sgf tree display, traversal (belongs in sgf.el); review game history
;;   in another buffer; branch subgame tree at arbitrary point
;; - subgame branch matriculation (maturity: child leaves the family)
;; - dribble the sgf tree
;; - "undo undo undoing"; integrate Emacs undo, GTP undo, subgame branching
;; - make buffer name format configurable (but enforce uniqueness)
;; - more tilde escapes for `gnugo-mode-line'
;; - make veneration configurable
;; - make animation more configurable; lift same-color-stones-only
;;   restriction; allow sequencing rather than lock-step; include sound
;; - [your hacking ideas here]

;;
;;
;; History
;; -------
;;
;; Originally gnugo.el was written to interact w/ "gnugo --mode text" and then
;; "gnugo --mode emacs" as the subprocess.  Those versions were released as
;; 1.x, w/ x < 14.  In Novemeber 2002, gnugo.el was changed to interact w/
;; "gnugo --mode gtp", but was released as 1.14 through 1.26, even though the
;; proper versions should be 2.0.x for "--mode gtp", and 2.1.x for XPM image
;; support.  (Sorry about the confusion.)
;;
;; Thus we arrive at at the current version.  The first gnugo.el to be
;; released w/ a `gnugo-version' variable is "2.2.0".  The versioning scheme
;; is strictly monotonically increasing numbers and dots, no letters or other
;; suffixes (and none of this even/odd crap).  Here we list, aside from the
;; bugfixes, some of the notable changes introduced in each released version:
;;
;; 2.2.x -- uncluttered, letters and numbers hidden, board centered
;;          buffer name shows last move and current player
;;          mode-line customization (var `gnugo-mode-line')
;;          new commands: `=', `h', `s', `F', `R', `l', `U', `C-c C-p'
;;          program option customization (var `gnugo-program')
;;          new hooks (vars `gnugo-post-move-hook', `gnugo-board-mode-hook')
;;          multiple independent buffers/games
;;          XPM set can be changed on the fly (global and/or local)
;;          font-locking for "X", "O", "[xo]"
;;          undo by N moves, by "move pair", or by board position
;;          grid (letters and numbers) visibility can be toggled
;;
;;
;; History Predicted
;; -----------------
;;
;; If you are an elisp programmer, this section might not apply to you;
;; the GPL allows you to define the future of the code you receive under
;; its terms, as long as you do not deny that freedom to subsequent users.
;;
;; For users who are not elisp programmers, you can look forward to gradual
;; refinement in 2.x, splitting into gnugo.el and sgf.el in 3.x, and then
;; eventual merging into GNU Emacs for 4.x (if RMS gives it the thumbs-up).
;; If it is not accepted into Emacs at that time, a new maintainer will be
;; sought.  In any case, it will no longer be bundled w/ ttn-pers-elisp.

some of the more stable properties.  You may wish to use them as part of
a `gnugo-post-move-hook' function, for example.  Be careful to preserve
the current buffer as `gnugo-state' is made into a buffer-local variable.

In the context of GNU Go, a group is called a \"dragon\" and may be
composed of more than one \"worm\" (set of directly-connected stones).
It is unclear to the gnugo.el author whether or not GNU Go supports
 - considering worms as groups in their own right; and
 - toggling group aliveness via GTP.
Due to these uncertainties, this command is only half complete; the
changes you may see in Emacs are not propagated to the gnugo subprocess.
Thus, GTP commands like `final_score' may give unexpected results.

If you are able to expose via GTP `change_dragon_status' in utils.c,
you may consider modifying the `gnugo-toggle-dead-group' source code
to enable full functionality."

;; The value of this property is a sub-plist, w/ sub-properties as follows:
;;
;; :full -- completely interpret the command string; the value is a
;;          func that takes the list of words derived from splitting the
;;          command string (minus the command) and handles everything.
;;
;; :output -- either a keyword specifying the preferred output method:
;;              :message -- show output in minibuffer
;;              :discard -- sometimes you just don't care;
;;            or a function that takes one arg, the output string, and
;;            handles it completely.   default is to switch to buffer
